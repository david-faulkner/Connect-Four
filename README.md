# Connect Four
 
This program allows two players to play the classic board game Connect Four using a GUI.
Each player is assigned a color and will use buttons to "drop" a game piece into the
board. Once either player has connected four pieces in a row, column, or diagonal of any
direction, the buttons will no longer be able to be pressed and the game will display
the winner.
